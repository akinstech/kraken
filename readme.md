# Kraken Release and Deployment Tool
This is a simple release and deployment tool for deploying applications and utilities to one or more servers in dfifferent environments

# Development Notes
## General
A project that uses kraken would have two key files:
1. krakenfile.js - A file containing all of the defined tasks for the project.  Optionally, this file may contain the config object.
2. config/kraken.js - A separate configuration file containing the config object which has the defined environments, servers, identities, etc.

These are kept separate so that the config file (which may have sensitive information, server names, key locations, etc) can remain out of source control and kept private.

## Execution
The kraken utility should be run with the following basic syntax:

```
kraken [environment] (task)
```

If task is ommited, then the default task defined should execute.

## Config file
The config file should define the environments, servers, and various paramters for each environment or server.  By default the kraken utility should look for a standard config file in known locations.
 - (project root)/kraken.js
 - ./config/kraken.js

Alternatively, a config file can be supplied as a command-line paramter.  (kraken --config=/path/to/config.js)
